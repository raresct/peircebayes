Debugging
=======================================

Everything you print in the PB program will appear in: 

.. code-block:: sh

    $vim /tmp/peircebayes/aprob.log

Other debug information and time profiling can be turned on by the '-d' switch and can be tracked in:

.. code-block:: sh

    $vim /tmp/peircebayes/pb.log
